The rev 2 board only works with 1 of the 2 NPN sensors that I have. Even though
the indication LED is lighting up the isolation chip is not going low and no
change is detected on the microcontroller.

For the one NPN sensor that is working, it's built-in LED is acting strange.
Under normal operation, the light integral to the sensor is off and turns on
when the sensor (proximity in this case) detects something. However when
connected to my board, it is on and dim. When the sensors detects something it
goes to full brightness.

This problem has to do with the protection diode built into the configurable
input circuit. Originally the circuit was supposed to be used in conjunction
with an optical isolator but now it uses a newer coupling technology. The diode
has a forward voltage of 1.25V. This is fine with the optical isolator because
the current is what triggers the signal to cross the isolation barrier but now
that voltage is the signal carrier, 1.25V at the input pin of the isolation IC
is in an undefind logic state, no good.

My solution is a simple one: go back to the optical isolators. I'm going to 
breadboard two channels with optical isolators to make sure it works how I want
then update the schematic and board. Overall it will make the unit cost cheaper
as well.

Rev 5 seems to work but when I went to test the amp draw on the high-side with
my fluke a couple of things blew up. I have no idea why either, going to solder
another board... then try some more testing. I'll get back to this.
